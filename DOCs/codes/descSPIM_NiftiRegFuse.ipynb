    "# Before Using This Code\n",
    "## 1. Dependencies\n",
    "This script relies on several Python packages as well as external tools. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages: nibabel, numpy, subprocess, os, multiprocessing, datetime\n",
    "External tool: ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools)\n",
    "You can install the required Python packages using pip:`pip install nibabel numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Install ANTs\n",
    "ANTs is a powerful tool that allows us to perform complex imaging tasks, such as image registration, that go beyond what's possible with standard Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-1. Easy build\n",
    "You can use this [bash script](https://github.com/dbsb-juntendo/descSPIM/blob/main/DOCs/codes/installants.sh) that downloads and installs ANTs in a unix environment with Bash shell. To use this script:  \n",
    "#### Download the Script\n",
    "Note that ANTs will be built in the same directory as this executable file is located, so you should save the file in the directory you want to build ANTs.\n",
    "#### Set Permissions\n",
    "You'll need to make the script executable. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:  \n",
    "`chmod +x installANTs.sh`\n",
    "#### Run the Script\n",
    "Now you can run the script using:  \n",
    "`./installANTs.sh`  \n",
    "The script will automatically download ANTs, build it, and install it in a directory called install under the current directory.\n",
    "#### Set Environment Variables\n",
    "After the script runs successfully, it will export ANTSPATH and PATH variables for the current session. However, these exports won't persist across sessions. For this, the script will add these export commands to your ~/.bashrc file (if you're using Bash).  \n",
    "To immediately apply these changes to your current terminal session, run:  \n",
    "`source ~/.bashrc`  \n",
    "If you're using a different shell or don't want to modify your ~/.bashrc, you'll need to manually add the appropriate export commands to your shell's configuration file or environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-2. Build on your own\n",
    "#### Download and install\n",
    "ANTs can be downloaded and installed from the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs. Follow the instructions there to build and install ANTs on your system.  \n",
    "For MAC and Linux users: https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS  \n",
    "For Windows users: https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Windows-10  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set ANTs Path\n",
    "After installing ANTs, you need to add it to your system's PATH so that your script can access the ANTs tools. This can be done by modifying your .bashrc file: Open a terminal and type `nano ~/.bashrc` to open your .bashrc file in a text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the file, add the following lines:  \n",
    "`export ANTSPATH=/path/to/ANTs/install/bin && export PATH=${ANTSPATH}:$PATH`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Replace /path/to/ANTs/install/bin with the path where you installed ANTs.Usually, the ANTs install path is shown at the end of the intalling log(standard outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Press CTRL+O to save the file, then CTRL+X to exit the text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal, type `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Verify ANTs Installation\n",
    "To verify that ANTs is installed correctly and can be accessed by your script, \n",
    "type `which antsRegistration` in the terminal. This should return the path to the antsRegistration executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the which command doesn't return anything, or you get an error, it means that the ANTs tools are not on your system's PATH. In this case, go back to step 3 and make sure you added the correct path to your .bashrc file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These instructions assume a Linux environment and a bash shell. If you are using a different system or shell, you might need to adjust these instructions accordingly.\n",
