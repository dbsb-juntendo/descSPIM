# descSPIM-basic



## Introduction

The descSPIM project aims to build an open-source microscopy platform that can be built with low cost and low optical expertise.

This is the image after construction. 

***

The main features of the current descSPIM setup are:

 ● Compatibility with many major clearing technologies, including **[CUBIC](https://www.tcichemicals.com/JP/en/search/?text=CUBIC)**  (Susaki et al., Cell 2014)
 
 ● The build can be completed in **a few hours to half a day**. 
 
 ● It does **not** require a high level of expertise. 

 ● All parts are commercially available (mostly from Thorlabs).

 ● **[Parts list](https://github.com/dbsb-juntendo/descSPIM/blob/main/descSPIM-basic.md#parts)** lists all required parts.
 
 ● Nearly isotropic sampling (X, Y, and Z) with axially swept light sheets for uniform Z resolution across the entire field of view

Inspired by the [openSPIM](https://openspim.org/), [openSPIN](https://sites.google.com/site/openspinmicroscopy/?pli=1&authuser=1) projects, the [mesoSPIM](https://github.com/mesoSPIM) and [mesoSPIM projects](https://mesospim.org/), the documentation for building and extending your own descSPIM is available here.

## Construction

### How to construct descSPIM?

The **descSPIM** is a light sheet microscope that does not require advanced optical expertise and can be constructed as if you were assembling a **block toy**. It can be constructed in about **a few hours**. A construction tutorial will be provided, and you can follow it as you go through the construction process.

## Preparations

・Marking on Breadboard (MB3045/M) just in case
