# descSPIM-basic



## Introduction

The descSPIM project aims to build an open-source microscopy platform that can be built with low cost and low expertise in optics.

***

The main features of the descSPIM-basic setup are:

 ● Compatibility with major tissue clearing technologies, including **CUBIC**, **BABB**, **3DISCO/iDISCO**, and **SHIELDS**.
 
 ● The construction can be completed in **half a day**. 
 
 ● It does **not** require a high level of microscopy expertise. 

 ● All parts are commercially available (mostly from Thorlabs).

 ● An affordable cost ($20k-50k) is achieved.
 
 ● A volume imaging completing within **a few minutes**.

## Construction

### How to construct descSPIM

**descSPIM** is a light-sheet microscope that you can build as if you were assembling a **block toy**. A construction tutorial is provided as follows. You can use the guide throughout the construction procedure.

Below is the manual for the construction procedure.
