# descSPIM

User-affordable and versatile light-sheet microscopy system for cleared specimens

We devised descSPIM  (user-affordable and versatile light-sheet microscopy system for cleared specimens) 
for researchers who have started to use tissue clearing and are having trouble findng a detection system.

# Concept

Current light-sheet microscopy systems present problems in implementation.
Since commercially available systems take a huge cost to purchase, and recent open source systems, such as mesoSPIM, 
require high-level expertise in optical system construction, most biologists find it difficult to utilize. 
We have therefore developed deskside-equipped SPIM for cleared specimens (descSPIM) as an affordable system which does not require the expertise to construct.
