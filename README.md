## What is descSPIM?

**descSPIM** : affordable and versatile light-sheet microscopy system for tissue clearing users

We devised descSPIM for researchers who have started to use tissue clearing and are having trouble findng a detection system.
This system, which is composed of minimal optical components aligned on a **300 mm x 450 mm optical breadboard**, enables
3D imaging of cleared specimens with a **sub-cellular spatial resolution**. Most optical components are
commercially available from a single company and can be constructed easily according to the drawings even by
end users who have **no expertise in optics**. Moreover, descSPIM has high expandability according to its
applications.

**✓ easy-to-build**

**✓ easy-to-operate (use a cuvette / no oil chamber)**

**✓ minimum cost ($20k-50k for descSPIM-basic, depending on the number of lasers)**

**✓ minimum space (all parts on a 300 mm x 450 mm breadboard)**

**✓ used on your bench side**

## Who is the descSPIM for?

For researchers interested in using **SPIM** (selective plane illumination microscopy) when imaging tissue using tissue clearing

## What are ideal imaging applications for a descSPIM?

・Primary means of imaging transparency samples with SPIM

・Visualization of cell populations or other structures (e.g. blood vessels, plaques) and sub-cellular structures (e.g. cell nuclei) in giant tissues (e.g. mouse half-brain)

## Concept

Current light-sheet microscopy systems have problems in implementation.
Since commercially available systems take a huge cost to purchase, and recent open source systems, such as mesoSPIM, 
require high-level expertise in optical system construction, most biologists find it difficult to utilize. 
We have therefore developed deskside-equipped SPIM for cleared specimens (descSPIM) as an affordable system which does not require the expertise to construct.
